        <p class="about-us-p2">
          Borjomi is a jewel of Georgia, nestled in the lush forests of the
          Lesser Caucasus mountains. Famous for its mineral waters, healing
          climate, and stunning natural beauty, Borjomi has been a beloved
          destination for centuries — once favored by Russian royalty and
          Georgian nobility alike. The town is best known for its naturally
          carbonated spring water, which flows from deep within volcanic rock
          and is bottled and sold worldwide. But there`s far more to Borjomi
          than its iconic water. Visitors are drawn to the peaceful atmosphere,
          scenic trails, ancient landmarks, and therapeutic resorts that make
          Borjomi a true sanctuary for rest and rejuvenation. Borjomi is also
          the gateway to the Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park — one of the
          largest protected areas in Europe — where travelers can explore
          diverse ecosystems, encounter rare wildlife, and enjoy some of
          Georgia`s most breathtaking landscapes. Rich in culture and
          hospitality, Borjomi welcomes all who seek a blend of nature,
          wellness, and tradition. Whether you're here for a weekend getaway or
          an extended retreat, Borjomi offers experiences that nourish both body
          and soul. Come discover why Borjomi is not just a place — it's a
          feeling you'll never forget.
